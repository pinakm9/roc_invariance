Hey doc, I got my OCT done today. Dr. Rupak said my retina is fine, no accumulation of fluidðŸ¥³. His summary just says "OU fovea dry". But I wasn't told about any possible reasons/remedies for the purple patch that's blocking my vision in the left eyeðŸ¥². 


If you want my medical history, never had any problems, hike regularly, can jog 10k, might be malnourished (don't eat egg, meat, fish, don't drink milk) but my diet is varied and not complete garbage (I thinkðŸ¤”), h-5'7, w-59kg. If I'm not outside, I do stare at screens all day.


I have been religiously taking the medicines you prescribed. My patch hasn't changed since you saw me (or maybe it has but it's so minute, my brain can't detect it). Have you ever seen these things go away on their own? I can book another appointment if you want. 


There's this famous Korean drama called Hospital Playlist and a friend of mine is a fan. Every doc is so nice there. I think they are based on you. Thanks for being nice to your patients. Annyeong!
